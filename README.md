# Sentinel and Scourge
## An autogenerated split standard keycap board

The interesting thing about this keyboard is that it's a declarative design:
* Layout is declared using [Ergogen](https://github.com/mrzealot/ergogen/). New: no fork needed!
* Automatic generation of PCB is taken from [soundmonster's samoklava](https://github.com/soundmonster/samoklava)
* The build system uses Ergogen to translate YAML to a KiCad PCB and plate files for FR-4 fab or laser cutting
* uses [kicad-automation-scripts](https://github.com/productize/kicad-automation-scripts) and [FreeRouting](https://github.com/freerouting/freerouting) to **automatically route the traces on the PCB**
* uses [KiKit](https://github.com/yaqwsx/KiKit) to render PCB previews (see top of this file) and production-ready **Gerber files**

## How to

If you would like to modify this:
* fork it
* change `config.yaml` to your liking
* push your changes; the `build.yml` GitHub Workflow will pick it up, autoroute and generate Gerbers, all in a zip file.
  See https://github.com/soundmonster/samoklava/actions
* or:
  * make sure to have Docker CLI and NodeJS installed
  * run `make setup clean all`
  * check the `output` folder for KiCad PCBs and Gerbers

See the [workflow](.github/workflows/build.yml) or the [Makefile](Makefile) for more details.
